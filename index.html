<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Assessment 1: My Profile</h1>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Personal Information</h2>
<p>Rashad Viviers</p>
<p>Student number: s3851521</p>
<p>Rashad.viviers1@gmail.com</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Background Information</h3>
<p>I am a 20-year-old student studying information technology as a bridge into software engineering. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe but moved to Australia when I was 4. Besides English I speak some Shona (The national language of Zimbabwe) and I am currently learning Korean. I started my schooling in 2005 at Algester Primary School and finished my Primary schooling there in 2011. I then moved to Stretton State College where I completed my senior schooling in 2016. After successfully completing my senior schooling I decided to further myself in multiple bachelors before deciding on Information Technology. I studied Engineering at Griffith University, Exercise Science at Australian Catholic University and Business at Griffith University. I have a huge passion for basketball which was the reason for choosing exercise science and a huge love of technology which majorly influenced my decision to do engineering and information technology.</p>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Interest in IT</h2>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">What my interest in IT is.</h3>
<p>I have loved mathematics and puzzles since I was a child. I really hoped my love for these two things could shine in the job I would one day have. I found out about software engineering last year and some of the day to day tasks completed by a software engineer and thought that it was an extremely attractive role. I unfortunately do not have any IT experience and thus am eager to soak up as much knowledge in this course.</p> 
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Why I chose to come to RMIT.</h3>
<p>I have an unhealthy obsession with earning and saving money. As a result of this I work 2 part time retail jobs that fill up my schedule. Working this much does not allow me the time to study a full-time course and as a result Online is the best option for me. RMIT is a well-known university when it comes to technological degrees and therefore it was my first option for this new journey I was entering.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">What I expect to learn during my studies.</h3>
<p>I hope to learn real world applications of the information I am gathering in this degree. The ability to put my knowledge into practice is vital as information technology is a very practical degree. There are so many practical applications of information technology and due to this, I hope to learn how to think in a creative manner. By thinking in a creative manner, I will be able to differ myself from other IT technicians that may be achieving the same qualifications as me.</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to me.</h3>
<p>The position calls for a software engineer. A software engineer deals with the crafting, designing and development of software. Once it is developed, they look after testing, evaluating and maintaining the software. This position is extremely appealing to me as I am a very creative person who like puzzles. As each problem is similar to a puzzle, I look to find the best solution of coding to perfectly fix the problem. The position is one that requires a lot of patience and resilience which are two of my strongest characteristics.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3> 
<p>The skills needed include the ability to code in multiple forms of coding. To get this high level of coding skill I will need to complete a degree in information technology. By completing the degree, I will learn the programming basics and advanced skills in all the types of code mentioned in the job description. The skill to work cohesively in a team of programmers is a necessity. The job description also implies that the person that fills this role would need to have an outgoing personality as they are willing to help the successful candidate build up their knowledge and fulfill personal goals in relations to programming.</p> 
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">A description of the skills, qualifications and experience I currently have.</h3> 
<p>Although I do have the ability to work cohesively in any team I am put into, I am unfortunately lacking the practical skills and knowledge of coding. I am very outgoing and find the idea of the employer being so open to supporting the successful candidate in their pursuit of personal development extremely attractive. I have the ability to think outside the box which will benefit me in creating each solution. I also possess a keen eye for detail which will make the designing and development process of creating the software a lot easier.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">A plan describing how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those I have now.</h3>
<p>The required skills in coding are only obtainable by university study. A qualification in Information technology will help me bridge into software engineering, where I can gain an understanding on each type of coding and how to put it into practice. To be placed into a role like this some experience in utilising university knowledge into practical use is necessary. To gain the necessary experience, I hope to hold an entry level position in a similar role.</p>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Profile</h2> 
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Myers Briggs Test</h3>
<p>The results of my MBTI were ESTJ &ndash; the supervisor or extraversion (E), sensing (s), thinking (t) and judgement (j). This means that my personality is that of a supervisor, someone who helps keep others on task. Someone who also takes charge in helping others organise and distribute tasks. This would require someone who is orderly, conscientious of others, is rule abiding and methodical. This is a role that is essential to a team. The ability to keep others on tasks will allow for success in any group you are put into and is a safeguard. Even if your group does not need the constant help to stay on task, it is still helpful to have someone delegate tasks. When creating a team, it is best to only have one supervisor as it can cause a series of clashes if more than one is placed on a team.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Online learning style test</h3>
<p>The results of the online learning test showed that I am a visual learner. This means that I learn better from visual stimulus as opposed to aural, verbal and kinaesthetic learning. This would require that visual stimuli would be the preferred method when information is being presented or shared within a group. This may become a problem if placed in a group with other learning styles. Although others may be able to grasp information I may have missed due to information being presented in a learning style I am not strong in, when coming together and displaying or sharing the information their would be discrepancies.<p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
<p>The big 5 personality test measures five major aspects of personality; conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness. The scores were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openness: 81%</li>
<li>Conscientiousness: 87.5%</li>
<li>Extraversion: 67%</li>
<li>Agreeableness: 83%</li>
<li>Neuroticism: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>These results show that my 3 strongest personality traits are openness which is the ability to think abstractly, conscientiousness which is the ability to have control and self-discipline when work needs to be prioritised and agreeableness which is the ability to place other&apos;s needs ahead of their own as well as the ability to cooperate with others instead of competing. The results show that when placed in a team, I can openly create ideas whilst using information from others. I am also able to help prioritise tasks correctly which is an important ability when placed in a team. When forming a team, I am able to work with most people as I have the ability to create ideas and incorporate other&apos;s ideas and knowledge into a solution.</p>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Project Ideas</h2>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Overview</h3>
<p>I propose an app and a device that allows the user to utilise its functions to both call and monitor the wearer of the device. The device should be a wristband and the app should be available to both IOS and Android devices. The basic monitoring needs should be heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. It is to be utilised with the elderly and those with illnesses or disabilities. The ability to drop in should be one way but an emergency drop in button will be added in case a call towards the user needs to be placed.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Motivation</h3>
<p>With the sudden explosion in cases of Covid-19, it is of utmost importance that people remain in self-quarantine. One of the major reasons people are travelling instead of locking down is to visit family or friends. With elderly people being most at risk of the virus, most travel would be directed towards them. The ability to drop in on those you hold near and dear that may not have the electronic understanding is vital and could help keep travelling to the minimum. The ability to monitor them from the comfort of an app will also minimise the travel.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Description</h3>
<p>One of the major features is the ability to drop in on the wearer or the ability to emergency drop in on the user of the app. This feature requires a camera and speaker on the device. As the elderly are forgetful it is important the device to either be large enough for them not to forget the device. By using the simple design of watch, the device can be constantly on the wearer and will not interfere with everyday life. By using the design of a watch, the device will be of a good size to not interfere with everyday life but will also be big enough for a camera, a screen and a mic.<p>
<p>Health monitoring is the other major feature of the device. The desired aspects it would monitor are body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. These are the easiest and most feasible of the human &quot;vitals&quot; to monitor in a device this size. These vitals are also very simplistic monitors of health.</p>
<p>The app will be essential to the project and will be used by those monitoring. As this device is being used to monitor, it will be of great use if a feature of the app was a tracker. Within this tracker, daily, weekly and monthly data will be stored and graphed. Not only is this a handy feature for overall monitoring and real-life data but by using this data, the app and device can calibrate to ensure that real data is used instead of estimates. When real data is used the accuracy of alerts and monitoring also increases. As this device is utilised with those in mind that are of utmost importance when it comes to care, the device needs to be useful in early detection of any health issues.</p>
<p>The devices ability to &quot;drop in&quot; will be paired with the feature of real time GPS. When logged into the app, the device will feed the wearers geographical location to the app. This will at most times minimise the need to constantly check in, especially when paired with the added addition of checking the vitals. The geographical location feature also plays a crucial part if anything were to go wrong with the wearer. When the emergency drop in button is used on the wearer&apos;s device, the device will attempt to contact 3 saved contacts within the database. Whoever picks up first will have the option to call the emergency number of whatever country the wearer is in. This is why it is imperative to have geographical location on the device.</p>
<p>The last feature will be the ability to share results and data recorded on the app. As we are in a digital age where electronic devices are utilised for everything,</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Tools and Technologies </h3>
<p>The software needed is one to develop an app for phones and tablets. The recommended software would be Appery.io due to the ability of the software to auto generate the coding for any components added. The easy to use interface makes designing and editing components simple. It is relatively cheap at $60 a month. The hardware needed would be the casing and shell of the device. The shell component will need to be sturdy due to the wearers and must be of a light material whilst being aesthetically appealing. A clean plastic casing with a comfortable yet breathable silicone wristband.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Skills Required</h3>
<p>To develop the project, it is vital that I have the skills in coding to pair up the devices and the app. I will also need the knowledge in hardware to design the components in the device that make t functional. These are extremely feasible to achieve and through my study within the Bachelor of Information Technology I will obtain the necessary knowledge.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, it would greatly impact those who care for the elderly, disabled and those with an illness. By mitigating the need for travel, quarantining the virus will be easier than ever. The devices could be used for a range of uses after the virus is contained. The function of dropping in on the device is extremely useful for children and those with disabilities. Through this product, the general population with illnesses, disabilities, the elderly and in particular those that take care of them will have peace of mind, however the device will give that peace of mind to a much wider group within the population.</p>
